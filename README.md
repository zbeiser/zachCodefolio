# zachCodefolio

## Description
The objective of this project was to get familiar with building a portfolio webpage from the ground up, no starting code provided, using only HTML and CSS. This required the synthesization of almost all of the concepts we've learned so far over the first couple of weeks of class. Not only did we need to create a webpage that was visually pleasing, but also functional in a number of different ways including navigational links and interactive hover selectors on text and images. Overall this was a proper first challenge in creating something from nothing using basic web development concepts.
